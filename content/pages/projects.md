Students will hand in four project assignments over the course of the semester. (All page counts assume double-spaced type.)

1.  Project 1, due Week 5: Response to the Qur'an and _hadith_ (short media piece or pp. 5–6)
2.  Project 2, due Week 9: Response to a piece of Islamic art (short media piece or pp. 5–6)
3.  Final project proposal: pp. 1–2 plus some preliminary media (e.g., 3–5 still images, 1–2 short sound or video recordings); pp. 3–4 for written projects
4.  Final project: A paper (pp. 20–25) or equivalent media piece that critical explores one or more of the themes from the class (in consultation with the professor)

Whether composing an audiovisual piece or writing, responses and the final project should engage with the primary and secondary literature we read (and see) in the class. All material should be handed in or put online with an emailed link (for media) by the beginning of the class in which it is due.

Sample student work is presented courtesy of the students and used with permission.

### MFA Visit and Response Questions

The week before Project 2 is due, students visited the Boston [Museum of Fine Arts](http://www.mfa.org/), and submitted responses to these questions: [MFA Response Questions (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit21m_289s15_assn_mfa)

Sample student work:

*   [Student #1 response to MFA visit (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit21m_289s15_assnmfa_ex1)

*   [Student #2 response to MFA visit (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit21m_289s15_assnmfa_ex2)

Final Project
-------------

All students are expected to meet with the professor in Week 10 to discuss ideas for the final project. Ideally this project will build on some of the themes or media approaches students have developed in the two response projects. Both writing and media projects will be graded on clarity and rigor of ideas, critical response to themes of the course, and polish in editing (regardless of medium!).

Due to copyright and privacy restrictions, we are unable to provide examples of student work on final projects. They included: a documentary video about a non-Muslim student's experience getting to know Muslim students at MIT; and an interactive program using the Ren'py visual novel engine that simulates a novice learner's challenges in memorizing and reciting Qur'an passages, making accidental substitutions of similar passages from other suras.
